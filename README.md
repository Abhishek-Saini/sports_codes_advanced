Relatively non-standard/un-common Competitive Programming Codes

* I read about and implement some non-standard algorithm once in a while. I will be keep adding to this repository.

Other general comments about repo -
* Every file will most likely have common 50 lines at the top. This is the templated code which allow one to write fast code in sports programming.
